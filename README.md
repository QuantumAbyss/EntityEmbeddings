# EntityEmbeddings
Researching the effect of using entity embeddings learned from a neural network as the input into machine learning models.

Inspiration for this project comes from the paper "Entity Embeddings of Categorical Variables" by Cheng Guo and Felix Berkhahn.

Acquiring the data is detailed in the code. Selection of columns is done through pre-processing steps as part
of the FastAI course and is not included here.
